    I am a deep tech architect and imaging pioneer with over two decades of experience spanning Apple, Meta, Nokia, and multiple startups. My work bridges the technical and creative — from inventing camera subsystems and AI vision pipelines for flagship products like Apple Vision Pro, to building autonomous drone-based lighting systems that redefined computational photography. My research has garnered over 1,000 citations and inspired innovations across AR, robotics, and embedded vision.

<p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
    I thrive at the intersection of perception, computation, and user experience — bringing systems-level thinking to everything I build. At Apple, I helped define foundational imaging features for future AI-first products. At MIT, I developed the <a class="text-blue-700 underline" href="https://news.mit.edu/2014/drone-lighting-0711">drone lighting system</a> that became a touchpoint for creative robotics. I’m also a passionate digital photographer with multiple solo exhibitions — see my work at <a class="text-blue-700 underline" href="https://mit.smugmug.com">mit.smugmug.com</a>.
