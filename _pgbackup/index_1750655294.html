                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I&rsquo;m Dr. Manohar Srikanth
System Architect &middot; AI Vision Pioneer &middot; Inventor</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4"></p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">I design AI you can wear &mdash; systems that see, sense, and respond seamlessly. I specialize in computational imaging, spatial perception, and intelligent camera architectures that power the future of wearable AI assistants, augmented reality, and human-computer interaction.
Over the past two decades, I&rsquo;ve helped shape flagship technologies at Apple, Meta, Nokia, and multiple startups. At Apple, I&rsquo;m currently leading the camera architecture for a next-generation wearable AI platform being developed inside the Vision Products Group &mdash; the same team behind Apple Vision Pro. I&rsquo;m also a co-inventor of the foundational passthrough system for Vision Pro (PCT/US2024/029534).
Earlier, I developed:
Apple&rsquo;s first behind-display camera prototype, enabling eye-contact FaceTime and notch-free design
Embedded vision systems for secure fingerprint imaging
A robotic and light-field based telepresence platform, years before Project Starline
Infrared light field tools for FaceID training via synthetic data
My Ph.D. from MIT focused on computational photography and robotics &mdash; including a widely cited project on drone-based lighting for cinematography. That work earned Best Paper honors and helped define new paradigms in creative robotics.
Beyond engineering, I&rsquo;m also a passionate digital photographer and visual storyteller. My work has been featured in exhibitions and publications &mdash; you can explore it here.</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">âœ¨ Vision
I believe the most compelling AI assistants will be ambient, context-aware, and emotionally aligned &mdash; systems that enhance focus, creativity, and everyday intelligence without demanding your attention.</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
ðŸ“¬ Let&rsquo;s Connect
I&rsquo;m always open to thoughtful conversations, collaborations, and advisory roles in the space of wearable AI, perception, and human-centered product design.
Feel free to reach out or explore some of my recent work and projects.</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">
    I thrive at the intersection of perception, computation, and user experience &mdash; bringing systems-level thinking to everything I build. At Apple, I helped define foundational imaging features for future AI-first products. At MIT, I developed the <a class="text-blue-700 underline" href="https://news.mit.edu/2014/drone-lighting-0711">drone lighting system</a> that became a touchpoint for creative robotics. I&rsquo;m also a passionate digital photographer with multiple solo exhibitions &mdash; see my work at <a class="text-blue-700 underline" href="https://mit.smugmug.com">mit.smugmug.com</a>. </p>
