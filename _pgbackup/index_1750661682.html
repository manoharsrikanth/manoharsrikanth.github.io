                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I&rsquo;m Dr. Manohar Srikanth, System Architect, Apple Inc. &middot; AI Vision Pioneer &middot; Inventor</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4"></p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">I design AI you can wear &mdash; systems that see, sense, and respond seamlessly. I specialize in computational imaging, spatial perception, and intelligent camera architectures that power the future of wearable AI assistants, augmented reality, and human-computer interaction.
Over the past two decades, I&rsquo;ve helped shape flagship technologies at Apple, Meta, Nokia, and multiple startups. At Apple, I&rsquo;m currently leading the camera architecture for a next-generation wearable AI platform being developed inside the Vision Products Group &mdash; the same team behind Apple Vision Pro. I&rsquo;m also a co-inventor of the foundational passthrough system for Vision Pro (PCT/US2024/029534).
Earlier, I developed:
Apple&rsquo;s first behind-display camera prototype, enabling eye-contact FaceTime and notch-free design
Embedded vision systems for secure fingerprint imaging
A robotic and light-field based telepresence platform, years before Project Starline
Infrared light field tools for FaceID training via synthetic data
My Ph.D. from MIT focused on computational photography and robotics &mdash; including a widely cited project on drone-based lighting for cinematography. That work earned Best Paper honors and helped define new paradigms in creative robotics.
Beyond engineering, I&rsquo;m also a passionate digital photographer and visual storyteller. My work has been featured in exhibitions and publications &mdash; you can explore it here.</p>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">âœ¨ Vision
I believe the most compelling AI assistants will be ambient, context-aware, and emotionally aligned &mdash; systems that enhance focus, creativity, and everyday intelligence without demanding your attention.</p>

                <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Apple Vision Pro <i>Foundational </i><i><span>Paten</span>t</i></h1>
                <p class="text-lg text-gray-800 mb-4">In 2015&mdash;well before &ldquo;spatial computing&rdquo; entered the mainstream&mdash;I envisioned a future where headsets wouldn&rsquo;t isolate people from the world, but weave the real and digital together. While most of the industry focused on immersion through detachment, I began prototyping a radically different approach: two stereo vision cameras mounted onto a commercial headset, capturing the world in front of the user and feeding it back into the display in real time. That rough prototype became the first internal demonstration of passthrough vision at Apple&mdash;and sparked a new direction.
What began as a technical curiosity quickly revealed its emotional power. Seeing your own hands, your room, or a friend through the headset shattered the barrier between real and virtual. It became clear that this was about more than optics&mdash;this was about presence, empathy, and trust. I helped define the essential technical metrics&mdash;latency, color fidelity, field of view, viewpoint translation&mdash;that would shape Apple&rsquo;s internal product vision for years to come.
That early groundwork contributed to U.S. Patent Application <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20240385454A1/" target="_blank" class="text-blue-700">US20240385454A1</a>, co-invented with a remarkable team that included Mike Rockwell, head of Apple&rsquo;s Vision Products Group. The patent captures a key architecture: a head-mounted display with integrated passthrough cameras, enabling immersive yet socially aware mixed reality.
It took eight years&mdash;and an extraordinary journey of innovation, iteration, and perseverance&mdash;before that vision became reality. In Feb 2nd 2024, Apple Vision Pro launched to the world. While I&rsquo;m proud to have planted one of the earliest seeds, I&rsquo;m even more honored to have contributed to a product built by thousands of brilliant people across the globe. Together, we crafted something that redefines how humans and technology can coexist&mdash;seamlessly, expressively, and with purpose.</p>
